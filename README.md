Thank the Author of the Original mod Ancient Total War for the original experience, im making this out of the love of the original mod. What's included: About 25 civs and 70 city-states, 121 units, 50 techs, ~120 buildings and 11 Wonders.
Combat: 

+Cities have much weaker attack but will need siege to take down, so it wont 1 shot peasant units

+Annexing cities locked by era,

+Units take healing and huge upkeep penalties in enemy lands, staying at war hurts economically â€“ as it should

+Military upkeep is brutally expensive included some favor of Historical realism: Spears cheaper, cavalry expensive, elephants insane, ships a luxury.

+Scout is now a range unit with 1 range (javelin throwing), with high withdraw chance this make skimisher still have their role in late era,

+Military Units gifted from City-States start with huge XP boost, this make CS have some better use in late era,

+Pillaging's yield +40% during the Archaic Age, +20% during the Imperial Age,

+City-State territory always counts as friendly territory during the Imperial Age,
